# Doubly Linked List

This project provides a TypeScript implementation of a doubly linked list. A doubly linked list is a data structure that allows efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal of elements in both forward and backward directions.

## Features

- **Strict Type Checking**: The project is developed with the `strict` compiler option enabled, ensuring type safety and catching potential errors at compile-time.
- **No Implicit Any**: The `noImplicitAny` compiler option is enabled, preventing the use of implicit `any` types and encouraging explicit type annotations for better code quality.
- **Type-Safe Operations**: The implementation avoids type assertions (`as`) and non-null assertions (`!`) to ensure type safety and reduce the risk of runtime errors.
